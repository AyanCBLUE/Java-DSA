This repository contains my practice work for
Data Structures and Algorithms using Java.

I am focusing on building strong fundamentals,
improving logic, and understanding how algorithms work.

## Topics covered
- Arrays
    - Reverse Array
    - Rotate Array
    - Two Sum

I will keep updating this repository as I progress.
